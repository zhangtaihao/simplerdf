  How to upgrade from older versions
=================================================

If you have been using 6.x-1.0-beta2 and would like to use the latest version,
please perform the following steps:

 1. Make sure you have Simple RDF User disabled (but NOT uninstalled).
 2. Remove the existing Simple RDF module tree.
 3. Extract the latest module to the directory.
 4. Run update.php to apply the latest database updates. (Naturally, you need
    to log in as user 1, i.e. admin or superuser).
 5. If Simple RDF SPARQL is enabled, install Simple RDF View.

After these steps have been performed in order without errors, you should be
able to use the latest module with your existing RDF mappings.

Note that any features exported with the old module will not work with the
latest version. Because of architectural changes, all mappings are now grouped
under Simple RDF, with each individual type prefixed in the name. You will have
to create the features again.
